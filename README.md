#Installation and Configuration Guide

The source code is found within the CHaTSiBot folder. All the classes are found in app/src/main/java/com/example/taphan/core1. All the xml files for the GUI are found in 
app/src/main/res/layout.

#The app can be run in two ways: 

To run the app on an emulator, download Android Studio to your computer. The CHaTSiBot file should be added to the AndroidStudioProjects workbench. You should then open this project in Android Studio. You should then click the play button (the green arrow in the top bar) to run the app. The project should be run from the “app” folder (so left for the run button it should say “app”). You will then be prompted to select an emulator. We have used Nexus 5X. Most of the team used API 25, but if you have any problems (in particular when signing up/logging in), try downloading an older API.
If you have an Android phone, we have also included an APK file so you can try the app on the phone. To use it, you should transfer the file to the phone and install it there. How this is done depends very much on the model, and often security issues get in the way. It is therefore probably most convenient to use the emulator.

Note that an internet connection is required.
To get answers right away from the app at any subject one can ask a question like: “When is my exam date ?” under a designated subject.
Under TDT4140 you can ask question regarding the subject as: “What is SEMAT?” or “What is software?”

If you want to try the professor features, you can create a professor account, and sign up in a subject. There might be some questions there, if not you can try asking a question of your own with another student user, and go back to answer the question. To see the answer, ask the question again with the student user.
